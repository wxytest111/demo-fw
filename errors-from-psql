PGPASSWORD=demopostgres psql -U demopostgres -h localhost -c "drop database ${DATABASE}"
might raise some problem, said:
psql: FATAL:  database "demopostgres" does not exist
it is because we don't execute `createdb demopostgres` before.

reason:
By default, postgres tries to connect to a database with the same name as your user. To prevent this default behaviour, just specify user and database: 
psql -U Username DatabaseName
